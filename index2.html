      Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
      origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
      (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
      vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
      traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
      pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
