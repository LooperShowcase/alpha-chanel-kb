      FIFA World Cup 2022: Teams qualified for Round of 16 - France, Brazil make
      cut - get full list
    </h2>
    <p>
      World Cup 2022 will be heading into its Round of 16 stage. The 32 teams
      competing at the Qatar 2022 World Cup were divided into eight groups -
      Group A to H - for the first phase. In every group, each team faces each
      other once in a single-headed round robin format and the top two teams
      from each group qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2022 Round of 16 - the
      first of the knockout stages. Reigning champions France, from Group D,
      were the first team to make the cut for the Round of 16 after winning
      their first two group games convincingly.
